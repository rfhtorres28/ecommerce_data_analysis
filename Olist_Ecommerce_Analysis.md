# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
Hello there! This project is all about the analysis of Brazilian Olist Web Ecommerce Performance that happens during 2016-2018. I performed the analysis using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Python for Data Quality assessment and Exploratory Data Analysis. For Data Visualization, I used Power BI and Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries.  


### Data Sources 
The CSV files are downloaded from kaggle website. I create a database on SQL Server and created tables for each file. 

### Tools 
* SQL Server
* Python
* Power BI
* Excel

  

Insights drawn from the analysis:

1. From the Day of Week Trend graph, it can be observed that the number of orders declines during weekdays and increases during 
weekends. I think most people during weekends have no work and has more time shopping online. Olist marketing team should focus more on
making effective campaign strategy during weekdays to increase its order sales. 

3. For Monthly Sales Trend in 2016-2018, the number of orders vs time  increases as time goes by. It peaks around
November-December of 2017 and goes down at January of 2018 but increases again as month goes by. It shows that 
Olist marketing strategy peforms well during this time period. 

4. Products in the Bed, Table, Bath category has the most number of orders. It also has the highest
consumer life time value. This means that most costumers in the data buys this product category. Olist should continue
the service and marketing strategy they are currently implementing to this product category to maintain these good metric values.

5. Insurance services has the least number of orders and received the lowest review score. Maybe the high average delivery time
was the reason for this low metric value. Olist should focus more on delivering this service to the costumer fast as possible to attain a 
high customer satisfaction.
