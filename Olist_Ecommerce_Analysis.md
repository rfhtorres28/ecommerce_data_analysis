Hello there! This project is all about the analysis of Brazilian Olist Web Ecommerce Data Set that happens in 2016-2018. I perform the analysis using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Python. For python, I was able to perform almost complete data processing from Data Collection (loading the CSV files and Joining Tables), Data Cleaning (Removing duplicates, Handling Missing values and Outliers) to Data Visualization (using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries). For SQL, the execution is almost the same with python except the handling of outliers and data plotting because of the abcense of scatterplot and histogram feature. Below are the insights and conclusion that was drawn from the analysis. 

Insights drawn from the analysis:

1. From the Day of Week Trend graph, it can be observed that the number of orders declines during weekdays and increases during 
weekends. Olist marketing team should focus more on making effective campaign strategy during weekdays
to increase its order sales. 

2. For Monthly Sales Trend in 2016-2018, the number of orders vs time  increases as time goes by. It peaks around
November-December of 2017 and goes down at January of 2018 but increases again as month goes by. It shows that 
Olist marketing strategy peforms well during this time period. 

3. Products in the Bed, Table, Bath category has the most number of orders. It also has the highest
consumer life time value. This means that most costumers in the data buys this product category. Olist should continue
the service and marketing strategy they are implementing to this product category to maintain these good metric values.

4. Insurance services has the least number of orders and received the lowest review score. Maybe the high average delivery time
was the reason for this low metric value. Olist should focus more on delivering this service to the costumer fast as possible to attain a 
high customer satisfaction.
